    - Bonfires now collide with most objects, including themself. This prevents accidentally placing multiple on top of each other.
    - Removed bonfire pollution generation.
    - Light glow added to vehicles to match player's glow. Should help driving and remote construction in unlit areas.
    - Removed spidertron eye lights, as they look weird in extreme darkness. (Headlights are still there)
