Version: 1.1.0
Date: 2025.05.15
  Changes:
    - Use Factorio 2.0.48 SolarPanelPrototype's new performance_at_night property to make solar work at night.
    - (Effective change is that the time is *actually* night now, so cloud shadows don't get rendered.)
    - Internally removed changes to lights that originally made them work at 'day'. (No longer needed)

Version: 1.0.1
Date: 2024.12.06
  Changes:
    - Bonfires now collide with most objects, including themself. This prevents accidentally placing multiple on top of each other.
    - Removed bonfire pollution generation.
    - Light glow added to vehicles to match player's glow. Should help driving and remote construction in unlit areas.
    - Removed spidertron eye lights, as they look weird in extreme darkness. (Headlights are still there)
